Relational database management system (RDBMS)

A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model. Many popular databases
currently in use are based on the relational database model. RDBMSs are a common choice for the storage of information in new databases used for financial
records, manufacturing and logistical information, personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s. Relational databases have often replaced legacy
hierarchical databases and network databases because they are easier to understand and use. However, relational databases have been challenged by object
databases, which were introduced in an attempt to address the object-relational impedance mismatch in relational databases, and XML databases. RDBMS is as
well a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in the form of related tables. Relational databases are powerful because they require few
assumptions about how data is related or how it will be extracted from the database. As a result, the same database can be viewed in many different ways.
An important feature of relational systems is that a single database can be spread across several tables. This differs from flat-file databases, in which each database
is self-contained in a single table. Almost all full-scale database systems are RDBMS's. Small database systems, however, use other designs that provide less
flexibility in posing queries.

RDBMS functions

	- provides data to be stored in tables
	- persists data in the form of rows and columns
	- provides facility primary key, to uniquely identify the rows
	- creates indexes for quicker data retrieval
	- provides a virtual table creation in which sensitive data can be stored and simplified query can be applied.(views)
	- sharing a common column in two or more tables(primary key and foreign key)
	- provides multi user accessibility that can be controlled by individual users
	- makes data management easier
	- makes for a flexible database that can respond to changing requirements
