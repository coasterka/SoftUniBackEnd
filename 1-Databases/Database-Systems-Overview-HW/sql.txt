SQL Language

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database
management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). In SQL, tables and
query results are lists of rows: the same row may occur multiple times, and the order of rows can be employed in queries.
The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:
	- clauses, which are constituent components of statements and queries (in some cases these are optional);
	- expressions, which can produce either scalar values, or tables consisting of columns and rows of data;
	- predicates, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (true/false/unknown) or Boolean truth values and
	  are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow;
	- queries, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria;
	- statements, which may have a persistent effect on schema and data, or may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions,
	  or diagnostics;
	- SQL statements also include the semicolon (";") statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is defined as a standard
	  part of the SQL grammar;
	- insignificant whitespace is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability.
	
A simple SQL query looks like this:

SELECT * FROM  [Books]
WHERE [price] > 100.00
ORDER BY [title];
