Database table

A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields (columns), and rows.
More detailed, a table is a set of data elements (values) using a model of vertical columns (which are identified by their name) and horizontal rows, the
cell being the unit where a row and column intersect. A table has a specified number of columns, but can have any number of rows. Each row is identified
by one or more values appearing in a particular column subset. The columns subset which uniquely identifies a row is called the primary key. A table is
usually a container of rows where a relation is a set and does not allow duplicates. Besides the actual data rows, tables generally have associated with
them some metadata, such as constraints on the table or on the values within particular columns. The data in a table does not have to be physically stored
in the database. Views are also relational tables, but their data are calculated at query time.
Tables can store many records, from a few dozen for a small database up to millions for a large company database. For example, a database for a business
would typically contain a table for customer information, which would store customers' account numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and so on as a series
of columns. Each single piece of data (such as the account number) is a field in the table. A column consists of all the entries in a single field, such as the
telephone numbers of all the customers. Fields, in turn, are organized as records, which are complete sets of information (such as the set of information about
a particular customer), each of which comprises a row.
