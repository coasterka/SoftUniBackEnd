T-SQL

T-SQL (Transact-SQL) is a set of programming extensions that add several features to the Structured Query Language (SQL) including
transaction control, exception and error handling, row processing, and declared variables. SQL was originally developed by IBM for
querying, altering and defining relational databases, using declarative statements. T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural
programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the
DELETE and UPDATE statements. Transact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate with an instance
of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.
