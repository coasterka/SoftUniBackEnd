Constraints

Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This
ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database. Constraints could be column level or table level. Column level constraints
are applied only to one column, whereas table level constraints are applied to the whole table.

Commonly used constraints

	- NOT NULL Constraint: Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.
	- DEFAULT Constraint: Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.
	- UNIQUE Constraint: Ensures that all values in a column are different.
	- PRIMARY Key: Uniquely identified each rows/records in a database table.
	- FOREIGN Key: Uniquely identified a rows/records in any another database table.
	- CHECK Constraint: The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.
	- INDEX: Use to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.
	
Integrity constraints

Integrity constraints are used to ensure accuracy and consistency of data in a relational database. Data integrity is handled in a relational
database through the concept of referential integrity. There are many types of integrity constraints that play a role in referential integrity (RI).
These constraints include Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique Constraints and other constraints mentioned above.
