Primary key

The primary key (PK) of a relational table uniquely identifies each record in the table. It can either be a normal attribute that is guaranteed to be unique
(such as Personal Identification Number in a table with no more than one record per person) or it can be generated by the DBMS (such as a globally
unique identifier, or GUID, in Microsoft SQL Server). Primary keys may consist of a single attribute or multiple attributes in combination. Primary keys
typically appear as columns in relational database tables. A primary key must contain a unique value for each row of data and it cannot contain
null values.

Foreign key

A foreign key (FK) is a column or combination of columns that is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables. You can create a foreign
key by defining a FOREIGN KEY constraint when you create or modify a table. In a foreign key reference, a link is created between two tables when the column
or columns that hold the primary key value for one table are referenced by the column or columns in another table. This column becomes a foreign key in the
second table. In simpler words, the foreign key is defined in a second table, but it refers to the primary key in the first table. A FK constraint does not have to
be linked only to a PK constraint in another table. It can also be defined to reference the columns of a UNIQUE constraint in another table. A foreign key can
contain null values.

Differences between PK and FK

	By means of tables
		- Primary key uniquely identify a record in the table.
		- Foreign key is a field in the table that is primary key in another table.
	Holding null values
		- Primary Key can't accept null values.
		- Foreign key can accept multiple null value.
	Indexation
		- By default, Primary key is clustered index and data in the database table is physically organized in the sequence of clustered index.
		- Foreign key do not automatically create an index, clustered or non-clustered. You can manually create an index on Foreign key.
	Count of PK and FK
		- We can have only one Primary key in a table.
		- We can have more than one Foreign key in a table.
