Benefits of normalization

	- Searching, sorting, and creating indexes is faster, since tables are narrower, and more rows fit on a data page.
	- You usually have more tables.
	- You can have more clustered indexes (one per table), so you get more flexibility in tuning queries.
	- Index searching is often faster, since indexes tend to be narrower and shorter.
	- More tables allow better use of segments to control physical placement of data.
	- You usually have fewer indexes per table, so data modification commands are faster.
	- Fewer null values and less redundant data, making your database more compact.
	- Triggers execute more quickly if you are not maintaining redundant data.
	- Data modification anomalies are reduced.
	- Normalization is conceptually cleaner and easier to maintain and change as your needs change.
