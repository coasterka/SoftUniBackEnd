Database normalization

Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy. Normalization
involves decomposing a table into less redundant (and smaller) tables but without losing information; defining foreign keys in the old table referencing
the primary keys of the new ones. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just
one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.

3 Normal Database Forms

	- First normal form
	  First normal form is a property of a relation in a relational database. A relation is in first normal form if the domain of each attribute contains only
	  atomic values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain. First normal form is an essential property of a relation
	  in a relational database. A database is in first normal form if it satisfies the following conditions:
		  - contains only atomic values
		  - there are no repeating groups
	  
	- Second normal form
	  Second normal form (2NF) is a normal form used in database normalization. A table that is in first normal form must meet additional criteria if it is
	  to qualify for second normal form. Specifically: a table is in 2NF if and only if it is in 1NF and no non-prime attribute is dependent on any proper
	  subset of any candidate key of the table. A non-prime attribute of a table is an attribute that is not a part of any candidate key of the table.
	  A database is in second normal form if it satisfies the following conditions:
		  - it is in first normal form
		  - all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key
		  
	- Third normal form
	  The third normal form (3NF) is a normal form used in database normalization. A table is in 3NF if and only if both of the following conditions are held:
		  - the relation R (table) is in second normal form (2NF)
		  - every non-prime attribute of R is non-transitively dependent on every superkey of R.
		  
	- Fourth normal form
	  Under fourth normal form, a record type should not contain two or more independent multi-valued facts about an entity. In addition, the record must
	  satisfy third normal form.
	  
	- Fifth normal form
	  Fifth normal form deals with cases where information can be reconstructed from smaller pieces of information that can be maintained with less
	  redundancy. Second, third, and fourth normal forms also serve this purpose, but fifth normal form generalizes to cases not covered by the others.
